## v0.7.7 - Extension-Boundary Checks and Audit-First Launch Safety (2026-04-16)

Focused on low-risk improvements that fit OmG's extension-native structure: safer recovery guidance when installs or hook paths drift, and clearer preflight gating before multi-lane execution starts.

### Changed

- Tightened extension-boundary diagnostics:
  - `commands/omg/doctor.toml`
  - treats stale or mixed extension roots, copied asset drift, and manual hook/skill shadowing as first-class readiness risks
- Hardened hook recovery guidance:
  - `commands/omg/hooks.toml`
  - prefers env/runtime controls plus extension-managed recovery paths before recommending direct edits to shipped hook files
- Promoted audit-first launch behavior:
  - `commands/omg/launch.toml`
  - non-trivial launches now treat `/omg:workspace audit` as the default preflight before `team-exec`
- Made workspace audit verdicts more actionable:
  - `commands/omg/workspace.toml`
  - dirty, untrusted, missing-baseline, or baseline-drifted active lanes are now explicit blockers until reconciled
- Refreshed docs and release metadata for `v0.7.7`:
  - `README.md`
  - `docs/README_ko.md`
  - `docs/index.html`
  - `docs/history.md`
  - `package.json`

- This release focuses on compatibility clarity and naming-surface safety for newer Gemini CLI UX.

## v0.4.1 - Usage Monitor Runtime Knobs (2026-03-20)

Added lightweight runtime controls to the built-in AfterAgent usage monitor so long sessions can reduce noise and redirect state persistence without changing the core extension flow.

### Added

- New usage-monitor runtime environment controls:
  - `OMG_HOOKS_QUIET=1` to suppress non-essential hook status output
  - `OMG_STATE_ROOT=<dir>` to store `quota-watch.json` outside the default `.omg/state` path

### Changed

- `hooks/scripts/after-agent-usage.js` now resolves state storage via `OMG_STATE_ROOT` when set.

### Added

- New workspace sub-action:
  - `/omg:workspace audit`
- New workspace/taskboard state conventions:
  - lane cleanliness/trust/handoff notes inside `.omg/state/workspace.json`
  - lane-health notes inside `.omg/state/taskboard.md`
- New hook lifecycle policy conventions:
  - blocked and early-finish derived hook signals
  - before/after symmetry and continuation re-entry rules in `.omg/state/hooks.json`

### Changed

- `workspace`, `taskboard`, `doctor`, `intent`, `launch`, and `status` now treat dirty/untrusted lane state as a first-class operational risk.
- `hooks`, `hooks-init`, `hooks-validate`, and `hooks-test` now validate lifecycle symmetry and blocked-continuation safety-lane re-entry.
- `team-assemble`, `team-plan`, `team-prd`, `team-exec`, `team-verify`, `team`, `stop`, and `cancel` now keep lane/subagent context explicit while collapsing normal-success verbosity.
- README, Korean README, and landing page updated with workspace audit, hook symmetry, and Gemini CLI `v0.33.0+` compatibility guidance.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.9`.

- `team-prd`, `team-exec`, and `team-verify` now align acceptance criteria, implementation slices, and verifier evidence to shared task IDs.
- `team`, `team-assemble`, `loop`, and `autopilot` now treat verifier-backed taskboard completion as part of done criteria.
- `launch`, `status`, `checkpoint`, `stop`, `cancel`, `cache`, `optimize`, `intent`, and `doctor` now recognize workspace/taskboard state.
- README, Korean README, and landing page updated with workspace/taskboard flows and cache-stability guidance.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.8`.

### Structural Fit Note

- OmG stays extension-native: no new runtime daemon, background worker, or git wrapper was added.
- Workspace/taskboard state is intentionally compact so long sessions can resume from a stable file anchor instead of replaying verbose chat history.

## v0.3.7 - Load Surface Cleanup (2026-03-10)

Fixed the extension manifest/context chain and reduced duplicated discovery surface so OmG loads through a thinner always-on prompt.

### Added

- New root extension context entrypoint:
  - `GEMINI.md`

### Changed

- `GEMINI.md` now imports `context/omg-core.md`, matching the manifest's `contextFileName`.
- `context/omg-core.md` trimmed to stable runtime rules only.
- Mirrored control-plane skills were removed; retained skills are now:
  - `$plan`
  - `$execute`
  - `$prd`
  - `$ralplan`
  - `$research`
  - `$context-optimize`
- High-traffic `/omg:*` commands were shortened by removing repeated output-format boilerplate.
- `doctor` diagnostics now validate the real context import chain and retained skill set.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.7`.

### Structural Fit Note

- OmG is now explicitly slash-command-first for operational control.
- Deep-work skills remain available, but overlapping command/skill mirrors were intentionally removed to shrink startup discovery overhead.

## v0.3.6 - Notification Routing (2026-03-10)

Added an extension-native notification policy layer so OmG can surface approvals, verification failures, blockers, checkpoints, and idle drift without depending on custom CLI flags.

### Added

- New notification command and skill:
  - `/omg:notify`
  - `$notify`
- New runtime-state conventions:
  - `.omg/state/notify.json`
  - `.omg/notify/*.md`

### Changed

- `context/omg-core.md` updated with notification controls, persisted state conventions, and worker-session notification safety rails.
- README, Korean README, and landing page updated with notification profile, channel, and activation guidance.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.6`.

### Structural Fit Note

- OmG notification routing remains extension-native and policy-driven.
- Actual desktop/webhook delivery is intentionally delegated to Gemini host hooks, shell adapters, or project-specific bridges.

## v0.3.5 - Dynamic Agent Team Assembly (2026-03-04)

Added an approval-gated dynamic team composition layer so OmG can assemble fit-for-task rosters before stage execution.

### Added

- New team assembly command and skill:
  - `/omg:team-assemble`
  - `$team-assemble`
- New specialist sub-agents:
  - `omg-director`
  - `omg-consultant`
  - `omg-editor`
- New guide:
  - `docs/guide/agent-team-assembly.md`
- New runtime-state convention:
  - `.omg/state/team-assembly.md`

### Changed

- `team` orchestration now supports optional stage-0 dynamic assembly.
- `intent` routing expanded with `team-assemble` classification path.
- `context/omg-core.md` updated with stage-0 lifecycle and roster state conventions.
- README, installation guide, and landing page expanded with team assembly flows, role taxonomy, and model-allocation policy.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.5`.

### Structural Fit Note

- OmG remains extension-native: assembly is prompt/state orchestrated.
- Team collaboration is modeled through explicit handoffs and verify/fix loops, not hidden runtime daemons.

## v0.3.4 - Deterministic Hook Orchestration (2026-02-28)

Added a hook-oriented orchestration layer inspired by additive hook-extension workflows, adapted for Gemini extension-native command/skill/state primitives.

### Added

- New hook command group:
  - `/omg:hooks`
  - `/omg:hooks-init`
  - `/omg:hooks-validate`
  - `/omg:hooks-test`
- New hook control skill:
  - `$hooks`
- New hook engineering guide:
  - `docs/guide/hook-engineering.md`
- New runtime-state artifacts for hook policy and verification:
  - `.omg/state/hooks.json`
  - `.omg/state/hooks-validation.md`
  - `.omg/state/hooks-last-test.md`
  - `.omg/hooks/*.md`

### Changed

- `context/omg-core.md` updated with hook controls, hook state conventions, and worker-session side-effect safety rail.
- README command/skill/docs map expanded with hook workflows.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.4`.

### Structural Fit Note

- OmG hook workflows remain extension-native (prompt/state-driven), not low-level terminal/runtime hook injection.
- Deterministic lanes and validation/test commands provide predictable behavior before autonomous execution loops.

## v0.3.3 - Claude-Style Memory Management (2026-02-28)

Integrated a Claude-style memory model into OmG using a compact root index, topic-split memory files, and path-aware modular rules.

### Added

- New memory command and skill:
  - `/omg:memory`
  - `$memory`
- New memory MCP tools:
  - `memory_bootstrap`
  - `memory_index_sync`
  - `memory_rules_resolve`
  - `memory_build_context`
- New file-based memory/rules guide:
  - `docs/guide/memory-management.md`
- New reusable memory scaffold assets generated by setup/bootstrap:
  - `MEMORY.md`
  - `.omg/memory/*.md`
  - `.omg/rules/*.md`

### Changed

- `omg setup` now bootstraps project memory index/topic/rule files.
- `context/omg-core.md` updated with memory command and runtime memory artifact conventions.
- README and landing docs updated to expose memory workflow in command/skill/interface maps.

### Structural Fit Note

- The memory workflow is implemented within extension-native assets and MCP tooling.
- Rule activation uses frontmatter (`description`, `globs`, `alwaysApply`) for task-conditional loading without bloating base context.

## v0.3.2 - HUD Visibility Controls (2026-02-26)

Added extension-native visual status controls inspired by statusline/HUD workflows from related harness projects.

### Added

- New HUD profile commands:
  - `/omg:hud`
  - `/omg:hud-on`
  - `/omg:hud-compact`
  - `/omg:hud-off`
- New HUD control skill:
  - `$hud`
- New runtime-state artifact for HUD profile persistence:
  - `.omg/state/hud.json`

### Changed

- `/omg:status` now renders a HUD section with visibility policy (`normal`, `compact`, `hidden`).
- `context/omg-core.md` updated with HUD control conventions.
- Local dashboard HUD now supports density toggle with `h` (`normal -> compact -> hidden`), top summary line, and `.omg/state/hud.json` sync.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.2`.

### Structural Fit Note

- Gemini Extensions currently support prompt/command/skill/state-driven visual summaries.
- Direct terminal statusline hook injection remains runtime-specific and outside extension-only primitives.

## v0.3.1 - Intent and Loop Guardrail Expansion (2026-02-26)

Added extension-native guardrail workflows inspired by cross-harness operational patterns.

### Added

- New intake/routing command and skill:
  - `/omg:intent`
  - `$intent`

  - `/omg:loop`
  - `$loop`
- New deep repository bootstrap command and skill:
  - `/omg:deep-init`
  - `$deep-init`
- New conditional rule injection command and skill:
  - `/omg:rules`
  - `$rules`
- New runtime-state artifacts for extension-guided persistence:
  - `.omg/state/intent.md`
  - `.omg/state/rules.md`
  - `.omg/state/deep-init.md`
  - `.omg/state/project-map.md`
  - `.omg/state/validation.md`

### Changed

- `context/omg-core.md` updated with intent-gating, conditional-rule, deep-init, and loop-discipline conventions.
- README command/skill map expanded with the new guardrail workflows.
- Extension/package version bumped to `0.3.1`.

### Structural Fit Note

- Extension-manifest primitives can represent policy-oriented orchestration (`commands/`, `skills/`, `context/`) directly.
- Runtime hook workers, background daemons, and low-level event hooks still require separate runtime code beyond extension-only assets.

## v0.3.0 - Workflow and Mode Expansion (2026-02-25)
