Context-engineering-powered multi-agent workflow pack for Gemini CLI.

> "Claude Code's core competitiveness isn't the Opus or Sonnet engine. It's Claude Code itself. Surprisingly, Gemini works well too when attached to Claude Code."
>
> - Jeongkyu Shin (CEO of Lablup Inc.), from a YouTube channel interview

This project started from that observation:
"What if we bring that harness model to Gemini CLI?"

OmG extends Gemini CLI from a single-session assistant into a structured, role-driven engineering workflow.

## What's New in v0.3.5

- Added dynamic team assembly entrypoints:
  - `/omg:team-assemble`
  - `$team-assemble`
- Added role-specialized teammates for non-coding and mixed workloads:
  - `omg-director` (orchestration)
  - `omg-consultant` (decision criteria and strategic analysis)
  - `omg-editor` (final output structuring and quality)
- Added approval-gated team assembly protocol:
  - Propose roster first
  - Ask explicit confirmation: "Proceed with this team? (yes/no)"
  - Run lifecycle only after approval
- Added model-allocation rule for predictable cost:
  - judgment/gates -> `gemini-3.1-pro`
  - implementation-heavy execution -> `gemini-3.1-flash`
  - broad low-risk exploration -> `gemini-3.1-flash-lite`
- Added runtime-state convention for assembled roster:
  - `.omg/state/team-assembly.md`

## At A Glance

| Item | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery model | Official Gemini CLI extension (`gemini-extension.json`) |
| Core building blocks | `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `context/` |
| Main use case | Complex implementation tasks that need plan -> execute -> review loops |
| Control surface | `/omg:*` commands + `$skill` workflows + sub-agent delegation |
| Default model strategy | Judgment/acceptance gates on `gemini-3.1-pro`, implementation-heavy work on `gemini-3.1-flash`, broad low-risk exploration on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` |

## Why OmG

| Problem in raw single-session flow | OmG response |
| --- | --- |
| Context gets mixed across planning and execution | Role-separated agents with focused responsibilities |
| Hard to keep progress visible in long tasks | Explicit workflow stages and command-driven status checks |
| Repetitive prompt engineering for common jobs | Reusable skill templates (`$plan`, `$team`, `$research`) |
| Drift between "what was decided" and "what was changed" | Review and debugging roles inside the same orchestration loop |

    participant Editor as omg-editor

    User->>Director: Request team execution
    Director->>User: Propose dynamic team + approval gate
    User->>Director: Approve roster
    Director->>Planner: Define goal and constraints
    Planner->>Architect: Validate technical direction (when needed)
    Architect-->>Planner: Design feedback and risk flags
    Planner->>Director: Hand off executable slices
    Director->>Executor: Assign implementation lane
    Executor->>Reviewer: Submit implementation result
    Reviewer-->>Executor: Accept or request fix
    Reviewer->>Debugger: Trigger on failing tests or regressions
    Debugger-->>Reviewer: Root cause + patch proposal
    Reviewer->>Director: Verification result
    Director->>Editor: Package validated output
    Editor-->>User: Final validated deliverable
```

## Dynamic Team Assembly

Use `team-assemble` when a fixed engineering roster is not enough.

- Split selection into:
  - domain specialists (problem expertise)
  - format specialists (report/content/output quality)
- Spawn parallel exploration lanes (`omg-researcher` xN) for broad discovery tasks.
- Route decisions through a judgment lane (`omg-consultant` or `omg-architect`).
- Keep verify/fix loops explicit (`omg-reviewer` -> `omg-verifier` -> `omg-debugger`).
- Require explicit approval before autonomous execution starts.

Example flow:

```text
/omg:team-assemble "Compare 3 competitors and produce an exec report"
-> proposes: researcher x3 + consultant + editor + director
-> asks: Proceed with this team? (yes/no)
-> after approval: team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix
```

Activation note:
- No separate research-preview setting is required in OmG.
- If the extension is loaded, `/omg:team-assemble` and `$team-assemble` are immediately available.

## Install

Install from GitHub using the official Gemini Extensions command:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/Joonghyun-Lee-Frieren/oh-my-gemini-cli
```

Verify in interactive mode:

```text
/extensions list
```

Verify in terminal mode:

```bash
gemini extensions list
```

Run a smoke test:

```text
/omg:status
```

Note: extension install/update commands run in terminal mode (`gemini extensions ...`), not in interactive slash-command mode.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings.filter is not a function` during install | Stale Gemini CLI runtime or stale cached extension metadata | Update Gemini CLI, uninstall extension, then reinstall from repository URL |
| `/omg:*` command not found | Extension not loaded in current session | Run `gemini extensions list`, then restart Gemini CLI session |
| Skill does not trigger | Skill frontmatter path mismatch | Confirm `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` exists and extension is reloaded |
| Team assembly keeps proposing but does not execute | Approval token missing in request | Reply with explicit approval (`yes`, `approve`, `go`, or `run`) |
| Autonomous flow confirms too often (or too little) | Approval posture not aligned to task risk | Run `/omg:approval suggest|auto|full-auto` and recheck guardrails |
| Setup health is unclear before long run | State/config drift accumulated | Run `/omg:doctor` (or `/omg:doctor team`) and apply remediation list |

## Migration Notes

| Legacy flow | Extension-first flow |
| --- | --- |
| Global package install + `omg setup` copy process | `gemini extensions install ...` |
| Runtime wired mainly through CLI scripts | Runtime wired through extension manifest primitives |
| Manual onboarding scripts | Native extension loading by Gemini CLI |

Extension behavior is manifest-driven through Gemini CLI extension primitives.
