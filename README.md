Context-engineering-powered multi-agent workflow pack for Gemini CLI.

> "Claude Code's core competitiveness isn't the Opus or Sonnet engine. It's Claude Code itself. Surprisingly, Gemini works well too when attached to Claude Code."
>
> - Jeongkyu Shin (CEO of Lablup Inc.), from a YouTube channel interview

This project started from that observation:
"What if we bring that harness model to Gemini CLI?"

OmG extends Gemini CLI from a single-session assistant into a structured, role-driven engineering workflow.

## What's New in v0.3.4

- Added extension-native hook orchestration controls:
  - `/omg:hooks`
  - `/omg:hooks-init`
  - `/omg:hooks-validate`
  - `/omg:hooks-test`
  - `$hooks`
- Added deterministic hook lanes (`P0-safety`, `P1-quality`, `P2-optimization`) with timeout/debounce/idempotency guidance
- Added derived signal policy for long sessions:
  - `context-drift`
  - `risk-spike`
  - `loop-stall`
  - `token-burst`
  - `blocker-repeat`
- Added hook runtime-state conventions:
  - `.omg/state/hooks.json`
  - `.omg/state/hooks-validation.md`
  - `.omg/state/hooks-last-test.md`
  - `.omg/hooks/*.md`
- Added hook engineering guide: `docs/guide/hook-engineering.md`

## At A Glance

| Item | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery model | Official Gemini CLI extension (`gemini-extension.json`) |
| Core building blocks | `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `context/` |
| Main use case | Complex implementation tasks that need plan -> execute -> review loops |
| Control surface | `/omg:*` commands + `$skill` workflows + sub-agent delegation |
| Default model strategy | Planning/architecture on `gemini-3.1-pro`, execution-heavy work on `gemini-3.1-flash` |

## Why OmG

| Problem in raw single-session flow | OmG response |
| --- | --- |
| Context gets mixed across planning and execution | Role-separated agents with focused responsibilities |
| Hard to keep progress visible in long tasks | Explicit workflow stages and command-driven status checks |
| Repetitive prompt engineering for common jobs | Reusable skill templates (`$plan`, `$team`, `$research`) |
| Drift between "what was decided" and "what was changed" | Review and debugging roles inside the same orchestration loop |

```

## Install

Install from GitHub using the official Gemini Extensions command:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/Joonghyun-Lee-Frieren/oh-my-gemini-cli
```

Verify in interactive mode:

```text
/extensions list
```

Verify in terminal mode:

```bash
gemini extensions list
```

Run a smoke test:

```text
/omg:status
```

Note: extension install/update commands run in terminal mode (`gemini extensions ...`), not in interactive slash-command mode.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings.filter is not a function` during install | Stale Gemini CLI runtime or stale cached extension metadata | Update Gemini CLI, uninstall extension, then reinstall from repository URL |
| `/omg:*` command not found | Extension not loaded in current session | Run `gemini extensions list`, then restart Gemini CLI session |
| Skill does not trigger | Skill frontmatter path mismatch | Confirm `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` exists and extension is reloaded |

## Migration Notes

| Legacy flow | Extension-first flow |
| --- | --- |
| Global package install + `omg setup` copy process | `gemini extensions install ...` |
| Runtime wired mainly through CLI scripts | Runtime wired through extension manifest primitives |
| Manual onboarding scripts | Native extension loading by Gemini CLI |

Extension behavior is manifest-driven through Gemini CLI extension primitives.
