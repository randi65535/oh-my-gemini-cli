Context-engineering-powered multi-agent workflow pack for Gemini CLI.

> "Claude Code's core competitiveness isn't the Opus or Sonnet engine. It's Claude Code itself. Surprisingly, Gemini works well too when attached to Claude Code."
>
> - Jeongkyu Shin (CEO of Lablup Inc.), from a YouTube channel interview

This project started from that observation:
"What if we bring that harness model to Gemini CLI?"

OmG extends Gemini CLI from a single-session assistant into a structured, role-driven engineering workflow.

## What's New in v0.3.8

- Added extension-native workspace/task tracking:
  - new `/omg:workspace` command for primary-root and lane/worktree mapping
  - new `/omg:taskboard` command for stable task IDs, owner lanes, and verifier-backed completion
- Tightened done criteria without adding runtime weight:
  - `team-plan` now emits stable task IDs and workspace hints
  - `team-exec`, `team-verify`, `loop`, and `autopilot` now use the taskboard as a compact source of truth
- Improved cache-safe long-session handoff:
  - `checkpoint`, `status`, `cache`, and `optimize` now prefer `.omg/state/taskboard.md` and `.omg/state/workspace.json`
  - long sessions can resume from compact state files instead of replaying verbose raw turns
- Kept the extension lightweight:
  - no new runtime daemon, background worker, or heavy always-on context
  - command surface expanded only with two slash commands and compact state files

## At A Glance

| Item | Summary |
| --- | --- |
| Delivery model | Official Gemini CLI extension (`gemini-extension.json`) |
| Core building blocks | `GEMINI.md`, `agents/`, `commands/`, `skills/`, `context/` |
| Main use case | Complex implementation tasks that need plan -> execute -> review loops |
| Control surface | Slash-command-first `/omg:*` control plane + 6 deep-work `$skills` + sub-agent delegation |
| Default model strategy | Judgment/acceptance gates on `gemini-3.1-pro`, implementation-heavy work on `gemini-3.1-flash`, broad low-risk exploration on `gemini-3.1-flash-lite` |

## Why OmG

| Problem in raw single-session flow | OmG response |
| --- | --- |
| Context gets mixed across planning and execution | Role-separated agents with focused responsibilities |
| Hard to keep progress visible in long tasks | Explicit workflow stages and command-driven status checks |
| Parallel lanes or worktrees drift out of sync | `workspace` + `taskboard` keep lane ownership, task IDs, and verification state compact and explicit |
| Repetitive prompt engineering for common jobs | Slash commands for operational control plus retained deep-work skills (`$plan`, `$execute`, `$research`) |
| Drift between "what was decided" and "what was changed" | Review and debugging roles inside the same orchestration loop |

```

## Dynamic Team Assembly

Use `team-assemble` when a fixed engineering roster is not enough.

- Split selection into:
  - domain specialists (problem expertise)
  - format specialists (report/content/output quality)
- Spawn parallel exploration lanes (`omg-researcher` xN) for broad discovery tasks.
- Route decisions through a judgment lane (`omg-consultant` or `omg-architect`).
- Assign reasoning effort per lane from global profile + teammate overrides.
- Keep verify/fix loops explicit (`omg-reviewer` -> `omg-verifier` -> `omg-debugger`).
- Run anti-slop check before final delivery.
- Require explicit approval before autonomous execution starts.

Example flow:

```text
/omg:team-assemble "Compare 3 competitors and produce an exec report"
-> proposes: researcher x3 + consultant + editor + director
-> asks: Proceed with this team? (yes/no)
-> after approval: team-plan -> team-prd -> team-exec -> team-verify -> team-fix
```

Activation note:
- No separate research-preview setting is required in OmG.
- If the extension is loaded, `/omg:team-assemble` is immediately available.

## Workspace and Taskboard Control

Use `workspace` and `taskboard` when work spans multiple roots, multiple implementation lanes, or long verify/fix loops.

- `/omg:workspace` keeps the primary root plus optional worktree/path lanes in `.omg/state/workspace.json`.
- `/omg:taskboard` keeps stable task IDs, owners, dependencies, statuses (`todo`, `ready`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `done`, `verified`), and evidence pointers in `.omg/state/taskboard.md`.
- `team-plan` seeds stable task IDs, `team-exec` pulls the smallest ready slice, and `team-verify` marks tasks verified only with evidence.
- `checkpoint` and `status` can reference these files instead of replaying the whole chat, which improves cache stability and reduces token waste.

Example flow:

```text
/omg:workspace set .
/omg:workspace add ../feature-auth omg-executor
/omg:taskboard sync
/omg:taskboard next
```

## Notification Routing

Use `notify` when a long-running OmG session needs explicit signals for approvals, verification outcomes, blockers, or idle drift.

- Supported profiles:
  - `quiet`: only urgent interruptions (`approval-needed`, `verify-failed`, `blocker-raised`, `session-stop`)
  - `balanced`: quiet + checkpoint and team-approval updates
  - `watchdog`: balanced + idle-watchdog alerts for unattended loops
- Supported channels:
  - `desktop` (host notification adapter)
  - `terminal-bell`
  - `file`
  - `webhook` (external bridge)
- Safety boundary:
  - OmG manages event routing, templates, and persisted policy
  - actual delivery must be implemented by Gemini host hooks, shell adapters, or project-specific webhook bridges
  - delegated worker sessions keep external dispatch disabled unless the user explicitly opts in

Example flow:

```text
/omg:notify profile watchdog
-> enables: approval-needed, verify-failed, blocker-raised, checkpoint-saved, idle-watchdog, session-stop
-> suggests channels: terminal-bell + file by default
-> persists policy: .omg/state/notify.json
```

## Install

Install from GitHub using the official Gemini Extensions command:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/Joonghyun-Lee-Frieren/oh-my-gemini-cli
```

Verify in interactive mode:

```text
/extensions list
```

Verify in terminal mode:

```bash
gemini extensions list
```

Run a smoke test:

```text
/omg:status
```

Note: extension install/update commands run in terminal mode (`gemini extensions ...`), not in interactive slash-command mode.

## Gemini CLI Compatibility Notes (Reviewed: 2026-03-11)

- Recommended runtime: Gemini CLI `v0.31.0+` for stable policy/plan-mode behavior in long sessions.
- Policy engine migration: if your wrapper scripts still pass `--allowed-tools`, migrate to `--policy` profiles (`--allowed-tools` was deprecated in Gemini CLI `v0.30.0`).
- Native `/plan` mode and OmG planning commands can coexist:
  - native: `/plan`
  - OmG staged flow: `/omg:team-plan`, `/omg:team-prd`
- Preview-only features (for example extension manifest plan-directory support from preview channel) are not required for OmG and are intentionally not enabled by default.

## Context Layer Model

| Layer | Source | Goal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | System / runtime constraints | Keep behavior aligned with platform guarantees |
| 2 | Project standards | Preserve team conventions and architecture intent |
| 3 | Thin `GEMINI.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and shared context | Maintain stable long-session memory without carrying heavy procedure every turn |
| 4 | Active task brief + workspace/taskboard state | Keep current objective, active lanes, and acceptance criteria visible |
| 5 | Latest execution traces | Feed immediate iteration and review loops without replaying full raw history |

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `settings.filter is not a function` during install | Stale Gemini CLI runtime or stale cached extension metadata | Update Gemini CLI, uninstall extension, then reinstall from repository URL |
| `/omg:*` command not found | Extension not loaded in current session | Run `gemini extensions list`, then restart Gemini CLI session |
| Skill does not trigger | Only the retained deep-work skills are still shipped, or extension metadata is stale | Recheck the retained skill list in the README and reload the extension/session |
| Team assembly keeps proposing but does not execute | Approval token missing in request | Reply with explicit approval (`yes`, `approve`, `go`, or `run`) |
| Parallel execution keeps colliding or re-planning the same files | Workspace lanes are not explicit | Run `/omg:workspace status` or set lane/path ownership with `/omg:workspace` |
| Done status keeps drifting after long loops | No compact task source of truth or missing verifier signoff | Run `/omg:taskboard sync`, then rerun `/omg:team-verify` to close remaining IDs |
| Output is verbose, generic, or repetitive | Reasoning/gate posture too weak for the target artifact | Raise `/omg:reasoning` effort (optionally teammate overrides) and rerun `/omg:team-verify` |
| Existing launch scripts use `--allowed-tools` | Flag deprecated in newer Gemini CLI | Replace with policy profiles via `--policy` and re-run |
| Autonomous flow confirms too often (or too little) | Approval posture not aligned to task risk | Run `/omg:approval suggest|auto|full-auto` and recheck guardrails |
| Setup health is unclear before long run | State/config drift accumulated | Run `/omg:doctor` (or `/omg:doctor team`) and apply remediation list |

## Migration Notes

| Legacy flow | Extension-first flow |
| --- | --- |
| Global package install + `omg setup` copy process | `gemini extensions install ...` |
| Runtime wired mainly through CLI scripts | Runtime wired through extension manifest primitives |
| Manual onboarding scripts | Native extension loading by Gemini CLI |

Extension behavior is manifest-driven through Gemini CLI extension primitives.
